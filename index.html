      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>The "About me" section has always been a puzzle for me. It feels like someone is asking me "What makes you You?" and I start thinking about the breaking points
        in my life that made me change something in my character or my way of thinking. 30 minutes later, I wake up from my day dream about "37 years of Samer's life"
        and I just start typing the expected story:<b>I was born and raised in Syria to an Arab father and Russian mother. I studied Computer Science, worked in Dubai for less than
          two years as a software developer, switched to journalism for almost 8 years, and now trying to get back to software developement. I believe that I have a beautiful mind,
          and I need the skills that will allow me to reflect that back to life. Hopefully, this course will help me achieve that and get paid for using my head :)</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Syria. Traveled and worked in many countries and ended up in Virginia US which feels like my new home!</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Hiking, Mushroom Hunting, Clay modeling, Cooking</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Small Restaurant owner + Web developer</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Woodbridge, Virginia</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have many ideas in my head but I don't have the skills to bring them to life. 
          Coding is fun and I know that I enjoy it because I can do it for long hours daily 
          without getting bored! 
          Getting stuck sucks, but it's very rewarding when a solution is found.</p>
